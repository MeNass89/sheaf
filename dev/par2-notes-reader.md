# Round 30, batch reader

- C-reader-037: Search ▸ In a folder… reads every PDF of the folder and its subfolders (the cap of 500 files is
  gone); the sheet says how many pages were found in how many PDFs, and when it stops at 2,000 pages found it says
  so and after how many PDFs. Acrobat's Advanced Search ▸ All PDF documents in a folder.
  (`a_folders_search_reads_every_pdf_and_says_when_it_stops`, smoke 311)
- C-reader-064: a text file (.txt, .md, .csv, .tsv, .json, .xml, .log, .ini) or a picture (PNG, JPEG, TIFF, GIF, BMP)
  opened with Sheaf opens in the reader to browse, as a preview PDF written to Sheaf's own temporary folder (JSON
  indented, tabs as spaces, characters Helvetica lacks as `[U+XXXX]`); the original is only read. Office and HTML
  files still open their conversion tool, as Stirling has no preview for them. Stirling's non-PDF viewer.
  (`text_json_and_pictures_become_a_pdf_to_browse`, `what_is_previewed_and_what_is_too_large`,
  `plan_keeps_existing_pdfs_and_reports_the_rest`, smoke 310)
- C-edit-028: Invert on CMYK JPEGs, with Adobe's inverted `/Decode [1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0]` or none, proved end to end
  on a rendered page: each colour becomes the opposite of what PDFium showed. Stirling's Invert.
  (`a_cmyk_jpeg_is_inverted_as_shown_with_or_without_its_decode`; the code was fixed in daf04f9)
- C-edit-010: a paragraph copied with the Edit tool is pasted in its own font, embedded fonts included: the font
  (descriptor, program, widths, Unicode map) is copied into the target file and the text written with it, its
  lines as they broke, as page text the Edit tool edits again. A paragraph whose font cannot write its own text
  again (mixed fonts, no Unicode map) still falls back to the nearest standard family. PDF Expert's ⌘C/⌘V.
  (`a_pasted_paragraph_keeps_its_embedded_font`)
- C-files-017: on macOS, Preferences ▸ Open PDFs with Sheaf by default also writes the six tools as Finder Quick
  Actions (`~/Library/Services/<tool> with Sheaf.workflow`, right-click ▸ Quick Actions and Services) and refreshes
  the Services list; each runs Sheaf with `--tool=<key>` and the files, as the Linux desktop actions and Windows
  verbs do. iLovePDF's context menu. (`each_menu_tool_is_a_quick_action_finder_shows_on_pdfs`)
- C-files-008 (Stirling's local library) and C-organize-024 (Acrobat's Create PDF Portfolio) were already built in
  round 29 (library.rs, sheaf-core portfolio.rs); never graded since the phase 4 baseline. Checked here with their
  tests and smoke 252 and 253.

## Left, and why

- C-files-017: the Quick Action bundles are checked on Linux (both property lists parse with plistlib, the shell
  command keeps each file one argument); Finder showing them needs a Mac to confirm.
- C-files-018: From scanner on macOS needs ImageCaptureCore through Objective-C, which only a Mac can build and
  test; phone scan works through iLovePDF's cloud (network feature, Nassim's decision). Not done.
- C-files-009 (cloud, network and shared files) and C-annotate-037 (shared review): cloud features, out of scope by
  Nassim's decision. Not done.
- not automatable: Finder lists the Quick Actions — needs macOS.

## New dependencies

None.

## C-reader-010 pinch on a real Mac (28/10, Opus, MBP)

Sol rev32 asked for a real macOS trackpad session. Done with real magnify events posted to WindowServer from the
MBP (pyobjc, CGEvent type 29 = gesture, field 110 = 8 zoom, 113 = scale step, 132 = phase 1/2/4), so they take
the trackpad's path: NSEvent magnify → winit PinchGesture → Slint ScaleRotateGestureHandler → zoom_at. On page
80 of 80 (End, then the pointer at 60 % of the window), slow steps (+6 %) then fast ones (+15 %) from 106 % to
800 %: the page point under the pointer stayed page 80, x 0.5040, y 0.2837–0.2838 at every one of ~25 events
(log of zoom_around's anchor, SHEAF_VIEWER_DEBUG, instrumented copy on the MBP only). Found: in one gesture,
fingers past 800 % then closing waited until the scale came back (1738 % asked, nothing shown). Fixed in
reader.slint (the gesture's start follows it past 10–800 %); test pinching_back_past_the_largest_zoom_shrinks_at_once;
on the MBP, the first step back now goes 800 → 720 %.
